DarkModeKit was designed and developed before Appleâ€˜s official dark mode release. It provides a mechanism to support dark mode for apps on iOS 11+ (including iOS 13).

## Features

- [x] Dark Mode support for iOS 11+
- [x] Dynamic theme change within the app without restart
- [x] Simple API design with minimal changes to your existing code

## Installation

### Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 11.0+
- Swift 5+

### Carthage

To integrate DarkModeKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```sh
github "microsoft/DarkModeKit"
```

### Swift Package Manager

Click "Files -> Swift Package Manager -> Add Package Dependency..." in Xcode's menu and search "https://github.com/microsoft/DarkModeKit"

### CocoaPods

To integrate DarkModeKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```sh
pod "DarkModeKit"
```

## Get Started

### How to Use DarkModeKit

To use DarkModeKit, provide a pair of colors or images instead of a single value. Simply replace existing colors/images with a pair of light and dark colors/images.

#### Colors

Swift
```swift
extension UIColor {
    init(_: DMNamespace, light: UIColor, dark: UIColor)
}

let color = UIColor(.dm, light: .white, dark: .black)
```

Objective-C
```objc
@interface UIColor (DarkModeKit)
- (UIColor *)dm_colorWithLightColor:(UIColor *)lightColor darkColor:(UIColor *)darkColor;
@end

UIColor *color = [UIColor dm_colorWithLightColor:UIColor.whiteColor darkColor:UIColor.blackColor];
```

#### Images

Swift
```swift
extension UIImage {
    init(_: DMNamespace, light: UIImage, dark: UIImage)
}

let lightImage = UIImage(named: "Light")!
let darkImage = UIImage(named: "Dark")!
let image = UIImage(.dm, light: lightImage, dark: darkImage)
```

Objective-C
```objc
@interface UIImage (DarkModeKit)
- (UIImage *)dm_imageWithLightImage:(UIImage *)lightImage darkImage:(UIImage *)darkImage;
@end
```

### Others

For more complex scenarios, DarkModeKit is similar to what Apple does in iOS 13 (some slight differences). It maintains a global `DMTraitCollection` which can be accessed through `DMTraitCollection.current` during custom layout. 

For more information on cases you should handle during layout, please refer to [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface#2993898).

DarkModeKit will notify views or view controllers in the current window when the theme changes by calling the following delegate method. 

Swift
```swift
protocol DMTraitEnvironment: NSObjectProtocol {
    func dmTraitCollectionDidChange(_ previousTraitCollection: DMTraitCollection?)
}
```

Objective-C
```objc
@protocol DMTraitEnvironment <NSObject>

- (void)dmTraitCollectionDidChange:(nullable DMTraitCollection *)previousTraitCollection;

@end
```
