# DarkModeKit

![](https://github.com/microsoft/DarkModeKit/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

DarkModeKit was designed and developed before Appleâ€˜s dark mode official release, so it provides your apps the ability to support dark mode for iOS 11+ (including iOS 13).

## Features

- [x] Dark Mode support for iOS 11+
- [x] Dynamic theme change within the app without restart
- [x] Simple API design. Limited changes to your existing code.

## Installation

### Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 11.0+
- Swift 5+

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate DarkModeKit into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, specify it in your `Package.swift`:

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/microsoft/DarkModeKit", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

### Carthage

To integrate DarkModeKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "microsoft/DarkModeKit" ~> 0.1.0
```

## Get Started

### How to Use DarkModeKit

The basic idea for adopting DarkModeKit is to provide a pair of colors or images instead of a single value.

#### Colors

Simply replace existing colors with a pair of light and dark colors:

```swift
UIColor(.dm, light: UIColor, dark: UIColor)
```

```objc
[UIColor dm_colorWithLightColor:darkColor:]
```

#### Images

Similarly, DarkModeKit also provides a convience initializer for images:

```swift
UIImage(.dm, light: UIImage, dark: UIImage)
```

```objc
[UIImage dm_imageWithLightImage:darkImage:]
```

### Others

For more complex scenarios, DarkModeKit will notify views or view controllers when current theme changes. The views and view controllers have to be in window hierarchy and conform to `DMTraitEnvironment` protocol.

```objc
@protocol DMTraitEnvironment <NSObject>

- (void)dmTraitCollectionDidChange:(nullable DMTraitCollection *)previousTraitCollection;

@end
```
