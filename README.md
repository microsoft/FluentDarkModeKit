FluentDarkModeKit was designed and developed before Appleâ€˜s official dark mode release. It provides a mechanism to support dark mode for apps on iOS 11+ (including iOS 13).

## Features

- [x] Dark Mode support for iOS 11+
- [x] Dynamic theme change within the app without restart
- [x] Simple API design with minimal changes to your existing code

## Installation

### Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 11.0+
- Swift 5.0+
- Git LFS

You can use Homebrew to install Git LFS:

```
brew install git-lfs
```

### Carthage

To integrate FluentDarkModeKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "microsoft/FluentDarkModeKit"
```

### Swift Package Manager

Click "Files -> Swift Package Manager -> Add Package Dependency..." in Xcode's menu and search "https://github.com/microsoft/FluentDarkModeKit"

Since Xcode uses its own tools to handle swifft packages, git-lfs might not be picked up if it is installed via Homebrew. Run the following command to create a symbolic link if Xcode fails to fetch the package:

```
ln -s /usr/local/bin/git-lfs $(xcode-select -p)/usr/bin/git-lfs
```

### CocoaPods

To integrate FluentDarkModeKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```
pod "FluentDarkModeKit"
```

## Get Started

### How to Use FluentDarkModeKit

To set up FluentDarkModeKit, you need to call the following methods first.

```swift
let configuration = DMEnvironmentConfiguration()
// optional, register a callback for theme change
configuration.themeChangeHandler = {
    print("theme changed")
}
// optional, whether UIImageAsset is used for dynamic image
// only available for iOS 13+, images marked with "Preserve
// Vector Data" is not to be used when it is set to true,
// default to false.
configuration.useImageAsset = false

DarkModeManager.setup(with: configuration)
DarkModeManager.register(with: UIApplication.shared)
```

To use FluentDarkModeKit, provide a pair of colors or images instead of a single value. Simply replace existing colors/images with a pair of light and dark colors/images.

#### Colors

```swift
extension UIColor {
    init(_ namespace: DMNamespace, light: UIColor, dark: UIColor)
    init(_ namespace: DMNamespace, dynamicProvider: @escaping (DMTraitCollection) -> UIColor)
}

let color1 = UIColor(.dm, light: .white, dark: .black)
let color2 = UIColor(.dm) { traitCollection in
    return traitCollection.userInterfaceStyle == .dark ? UIColor.black : UIColor.white
}
```

#### Images

```swift
extension UIImage {
    init(_ namespace: DMNamespace, light: UIImage, dark: UIImage)
}

let lightImage = UIImage(named: "Light")!
let darkImage = UIImage(named: "Dark")!
let image = UIImage(.dm, light: lightImage, dark: darkImage)
```

#### Change Theme

```swift
DMTraitCollection.setOverride(DMTraitCollection(userInterfaceStyle: .light), animated: true) // Change to light theme with animation
DMTraitCollection.setOverride(DMTraitCollection(userInterfaceStyle: .unspecified), animated: true) // Change to "follow system" theme
```

### Others

For more complex scenarios, FluentDarkModeKit is similar to what Apple does in iOS 13 (some slight differences). It maintains a global `DMTraitCollection` which can be accessed through `DMTraitCollection.current` during custom layout. 

For more information on cases you should handle during layout, please refer to [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface#2993898).

FluentDarkModeKit will notify views or view controllers in the current window when the theme changes by calling the following delegate method. 

```swift
protocol DMTraitEnvironment: NSObjectProtocol {
    func dmTraitCollectionDidChange(_ previousTraitCollection: DMTraitCollection?)
}
```
